# P1: Predicting COVID Deaths with PyTorch

## Overview

In this project, we'll use PyTorch to create a regression model that
can predict how many deaths there will be for a WI census tract, given
the number of people who have tested positive, broken down by age.
The train.csv and test.csv files we provide are based on this dataset:
https://data.dhsgis.wi.gov/datasets/wi-dhs::covid-19-vaccination-data-by-census-tract

Learning objectives:
* multiply tensors
* use GPUs (when available)
* optimize inputs to minimize outputs
* use optimization to optimize regression coefficients


## Part 1: Prediction with Hardcoded Model

Install some packages:

```
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html torch==1.13.1+cpu
pip3 install tensorboard
```

Use train.csv and test.csv to construct four PyTorch tensors:
`trainX`, `trainY`, `testX`, and `testY`.  Hints:

* you can use `pd.read_csv` to load CSVs to DataFrames
* you can use use `df.values` to get a numpy array from a DataFrame
* you can convert from numpy to PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/tensorqs_tutorial.html)
* you'll need to do some 2D slicing: the last column contains your y values and the others contain your X values

`trainX` (number of positive COVID tests per tract, by age group) should look like this:

```python
tensor([[ 24.,  51.,  44.,  ...,  61.,  27.,   0.],
        [ 22.,  31., 214.,  ...,   9.,   0.,   0.],
        [ 84., 126., 239.,  ...,  74.,  24.,   8.],
        ...,
        [268., 358., 277.,  ..., 107.,  47.,   7.],
        [ 81., 116.,  90.,  ...,  36.,   9.,   0.],
        [118., 156., 197.,  ...,  19.,   0.,   0.]], dtype=torch.float64)
```

`trainY` (number of COVID deaths per tract) should look like this (make sure it is vertical, not 1 dimensional!):

```python
tensor([[3.],
        [2.],
        [9.],
        ...,
        [5.],
        [2.],
        [5.]], dtype=torch.float64)
```

Let's predict the number of COVID deaths in the test dataset under the
assumption that the deathrate is 0.004 for those <60 and 0.03 for those >=60.
Encode these assumptions as coefficients in a tensor by pasting
the following:

```python
coef = torch.tensor([
        [0.0040],
        [0.0040],
        [0.0040],
        [0.0040],
        [0.0040],
        [0.0040], # POS_50_59_CP
        [0.0300], # POS_60_69_CP
        [0.0300],
        [0.0300],
        [0.0300]
], dtype=testX.dtype)
coef
```

Multiply the first row `testX` by the `coef` vector and use `.item()`
to print the predicted number of deaths in this tract.

Requirement: your code should be written such that if
`torch.cuda.is_available()` is true, all your tensors (`trainX`,
`trainY`, `testX`, `testY`, and `coef`) should be move to a GPU prior
to any multiplication.

## Part 2: R^2 Score

Create a `predictedY` tensor by multiplying all of `testX` by `coef`.
We'll measure the quality of these predictions by writing a function
that can compare `predictedY` to the true values in `testY`.

The R^2 score
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) can be
used as a measure of how much variance is a y column a model can
predict (with 1 being the best score).  Different definitions are
sometimes used, but we'll define it in terms of two variables:

* **SStot**.  To compute this, first compute the average testY value.  Subtract to get the difference between each testY value and the average.  Square the differences, then add the results to get `SStot`
* **SSreg**.  Same as SStot, but instead of subtracting the average from each testY value, subtract the prediction from `testY`

If our predictions are good, `SSreg` will be much smaller than `SStot`.  So define `improvement = SStot - SSreg`.

The R^2 score is just `improvement/SStot`.

Generalize the above logic into an `r2_score(trueY, predictedY)` that
you write that can compute the R^2 score given any vector of true
values alongside a vector of predictions.

Call `r2_score(testY, predictedY)` and display the value in your notebook.

## Part 3: Optimization

Let's say `y = x^2 - 8x + 19`.  We want to find the x value that minimizes y.

First, what is y when x is a tensor containing 0.0?

```python
x = torch.tensor(0.0)
y = x**2 - 8*x + 19
y
```

We can use a PyTorch optimizer to try to find a good x value.  The
optimizer will run a loop where it computes y, computes how a small
change in x would effect y, then makes a small change to x to try to
make y smaller.

There are many optimizers in PyTorch; we'll use SGD here.  You can
create the optimizer like this:

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([????], lr=0.1)
```

For `????`, you can pass in one or more tensors that you're trying to
optimize (in this case, you're trying to find the best value for `x`).

The optimizer is based on gradients (an idea from Calculus, but you
don't need to know Calculus to do this project).  You'll need to pass
`requires_grad=True` to `torch.tensor` in your earlier code that
defined `x` so that we can track gradients.

Write a loop that executes the following 30 times:

```python
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    y = ????
    y.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(x, y)
```

Notice the small changes to x with each iteration (and resulting
changes to y).  Report `x.item()` in your notebook as the optimized
value.

Create a line plot of x and y values to verify that best x value you
found via optimization seems about right.

## Part 4: Linear Regression

In part 1, you used a hardcoded `coef` vector to predict COVID deaths.  Now, you will start with random coefficients and optimize them.

Steps:
* create a TensorDataset (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.TensorDataset) from your trainX and trainY.
* create a DataLoader (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) that uses your dataset
  * use shuffle
  * try different batch sizes and decide what size to use
* create a simple linear model by initializing `torch.nn.Linear`
  * choose the size based on trainX and trainY
* create an optimizer from `torch.optim.SGD` that will optimize the `.weight` and `.bias` parameters of your model
* write a training loop to optimize your model with data from your DataLoader
  * try different numbers of epochs
  * calculate your loss with `torch.nn.MSELoss`

Requirements:
* report the `r2_score` of your predictions on the test data; you must get >0.5
* print out how long training took to run
* create a bar plot showing each of the numbers in your `model.weight` tensor.  The x-axis should indicate the column names corresponding to each coefficient (from train.columns)

Tips:
* it can be tricky choosing a good learning rate.  You can use tensorboard to better see what is happening as you tune it: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tensorboard_with_pytorch.html#using-tensorboard-in-pytorch
* if loss is fluctuating a lot even near the end of training, you might consider using a learning rate scheduler (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate) to slow learning down near the end.  The project is certainly possible without this, however.
* pay close attention to warnings about broadcasting and shapes.  Resolve that before proceeding with other troubleshooting.
